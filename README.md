# FortiGate Policy Diff

A Python tool for comparing FortiGate firewall configuration files.  
It detects **new**, **removed**, and **modified** firewall policies based on their **UUIDs** and provides a detailed **attribute-level diff** of modified policy blocks.

## Features
- üîé Detects **new policies** (only in the new config)  
- üóëÔ∏è Detects **removed policies** (only in the old config)  
- ‚úèÔ∏è Detects **modified policies** (same UUID but different content)  
- üìä Shows differences in a clear **table format**  
- üìù Exports the full diff to a text file (`policy_diff.txt`)  

## Instructions
1. Place the script together with the old FortiGate configuration (`old.conf`) and new FortiGate configuration (`new.conf`) in the same folder.  
2. Run the script:  

```bash
python policy_diff.py
```
3. Results will be printed in the terminal and written to policy_diff.txt.
